# Storyline  
A single person thousands of years ago discovered and harnessed death magic and became the first Necromancer. After reaching the peak of his era he finally succumbed to old age and let his soul rest. However, a couple thousand years later he awakens in a skeleton body that has been enslaved to a lich. Being stuck in the tomb of said lich, he must fight against its hordes of undead to escape the fleeting clutches of losing his memory and succumbing to the lich's control.
# Gameplay
So far its a basic hack and slash where W A S D are the movement keys and E is to attack at the moment. In the future, I may want to add a jumping option/animation and also add more diverse monsters as levels are added. Also may give the character more abilities as they progress, as he regains some of his power from when he was alive.
